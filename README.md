#### Junior dev test

### User stories

```
As a user,
I want to be able to select a Client from a list,
So I can provide a Client with workers.
```
```
As a user,
I want to be able to see which Candidate is closest to the Clientâ€™s location,
So I can find the most suitable workers to send to the Client.

```
```
As a user,
I want to see the time and distance to travel to the Client based on various modes of travel,
So I can send the nearest candidate to a Client.
```

### MVP
```
User sees the lists of clients, clicks the link and sees all the candidates in order from the nearest.
```
